## _**~ Obfuscation ~**_

<br/>

### **Benefits**

Obfuscation is the process of making something difficult to understand, typically by using complex or confusing language or code. In the context of programming, it can refer to making code harder to understand or reverse-engineer. Using an AI to obfuscate code can potentially make the resulting code even more difficult to understand, as the AI may be able to generate code that is more complex and less predictable than what a human programmer could create. Additionally, using an AI for obfuscation can save time and effort, as the AI can automate the process of creating the obfuscated code.

<br/>

### **Limitations**

 When it comes to using AI for Lua obfuscation, the limitations are similar to those of using AI for obfuscation in general. These include the potential for slow processing times, brittle and fragile algorithms, and the expense of training and maintaining the AI.

In addition to these general limitations, there may also be some specific challenges when using AI for Lua obfuscation. For example, because Lua is a dynamically typed language, it can be more difficult for an AI algorithm to understand and interpret the code. This can make it harder for the AI to effectively obfuscate the scripts, and may require the use of more complex and resource-intensive algorithms.

Another challenge of using AI for Lua obfuscation is that Lua is a relatively simple and lightweight language. This means that it may be relatively easy for a people to manually obfuscate Lua scripts, making it less necessary to use AI for this purpose.

Overall, while AI algorithms can potentially be useful for obfuscating Lua scripts, there are a number of limitations and challenges that need to be considered before using them for this purpose.

<br/>

### **Explanation**

Our technique will involve training a machine learning model on a large dataset of lua scripts that have been manually obfuscated/deobfuscated by people and other obfuscators. The model will learn the patterns and techniques used to obfuscate and deobfuscate the lua scripts, such as renaming variables and functions, adding unnecessary code, and using complex control flow structures.

Once the model has been trained, we will use it to automatically obfuscate and deobfuscate new lua scripts. The model will take a clean, readable lua script as input, and it will output an obfuscated version of the script that is difficult for people to understand. However, the obfuscated script will still be function and will produce the same output as the original script when executed.

In this way, out technique will use artificial intelligence to automatically obfuscate and deobfuscate lua scripts, providing clear, protected and unprotected versions of the scripts that are difficult and easy for people to understand and modify. This will help to protect the intellectual property of the scripts and prevent them from being reverse-engineered or modified without permission.

It is important to note that our technique is not a perfect method of obfuscation and deobfuscation. Even though our AI model can make it difficult for people to understand and modify the obfuscated scripts, determined individuals with necessary knowledge and dedication can still reverse-engineer the code and modify it if they are determined to do so. Same with the deobfuscation, people who have great determination to making a secure lua obfuscator can make it harder for our AI to understand its patterns, which means the AI would require more computation power meaning we'll need more resources and a larger dataset. (The dataset will consist of 200 Obfuscated scripts, 200 Deobfuscated scripts, 200 Manually deobfuscated scripts, 200 Manually obfuscated scripts. Which equals 800 scripts. 100 of each will be sent to training set and test set. We will try our hardest to get the most accurate predictions possible.)

<br/>

A standard breakdown is to put 70-80% of the data in the trainging set and 20-30% in the test set, but i'ma put 50-50 in each.
